# Essential Coding Patterns for Technical Interviews (Java)

Hey folks! After going through countless technical interviews (both as a candidate and an interviewer), I've noticed that certain algorithmic patterns come up again and again. Learning these patterns can dramatically improve your problem-solving skills and interview performance.

Today, I'm sharing the most common patterns you should know before your next interview. For each pattern, I'll explain:
- When and why you'd use it
- How it works conceptually
- A real interview problem with Java solution
- Time and space complexity breakdown

Let's dive in! üë®‚Äçüíª

## 1. Heap for Top-K Elements

**When to use it:**
Need to repeatedly access the largest/smallest K elements from a dataset? Heaps are your friend! They're perfect when you need to maintain a "running best" collection of items.

**Why it works:**
A heap gives you O(log K) time for insertions and deletions while maintaining the highest/lowest priority elements at the top. This beats sorting the entire array every time - especially when dealing with streams of data.

**Example: [LeetCode 215 ‚Äì Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)**

Let's say we have an array `[3,2,1,5,6,4]` and we need to find the 2nd largest element (k=2).

```java
public int findKthLargest(int[] nums, int k) {
    // Using a min heap of size k
    // We'll keep our k largest elements in the heap
    PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
    
    for (int num : nums) {
        // Add the current number to our heap
        minHeap.offer(num);
        
        // If heap size exceeds k, remove the smallest element
        // This ensures we always have k largest elements
        if (minHeap.size() > k) {
            minHeap.poll();
        }
    }
    
    // The root of our min heap will be the kth largest element
    return minHeap.peek();
}
```

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n log k) where n is the array length
- Space: O(k) for storing the heap

> **Note:** In Java, we use the PriorityQueue class which implements a min heap by default. For a max heap, you can use a custom comparator: `new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder())`. This is a key advantage of Java's standard library for interview questions.

## 2. HashMap / HashSet

**When to use it:**
HashMaps and HashSets are your go-to for problems that need quick lookups, frequency counting, or duplicate detection. They're essential for reducing time complexity from O(n¬≤) to O(n).

**Why it works:**
With average O(1) lookup times, you can check if something exists, count occurrences, or store additional info about each element without repeated array scans.

**Example: [LeetCode 1 ‚Äì Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)**

We need to find two numbers in an array that add up to a target value.

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    // Store numbers we've seen and their indices
    Map<Integer, Integer> seen = new HashMap<>();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Calculate what number we need to find
        int complement = target - nums[i];
        
        // If we've seen this complement before, we found our pair!
        if (seen.containsKey(complement)) {
            return new int[] {seen.get(complement), i};
        }
        
        // Otherwise, store this number for future lookups
        seen.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    
    // No solution found
    return new int[] {};
}
```

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n) - we only need to go through the array once
- Space: O(n) - in the worst case, we store almost all elements in our hash map

I honestly use this pattern all the time, even outside of interviews. It's probably the most practical day-to-day pattern for simplifying algorithm logic.

## 3. Sliding Window

**When to use it:**
The sliding window technique shines when you need to find or optimize over contiguous subarrays or substrings. It's especially powerful for problems involving:
- Maximum/minimum subarrays of fixed size
- Longest substring with certain properties
- Finding substrings with constraints

**Why it works:**
Instead of recalculating from scratch, a sliding window maintains and updates a "window" of elements as it moves through the array, avoiding redundant work.

**Example: [LeetCode 3 ‚Äì Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)**

```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    int maxLength = 0;
    int windowStart = 0;
    Map<Character, Integer> charMap = new HashMap<>(); // Tracks character positions
    
    // Extend the window one character at a time
    for (int windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < s.length(); windowEnd++) {
        char rightChar = s.charAt(windowEnd);
        
        // If we've seen this character before and it's inside our current window
        if (charMap.containsKey(rightChar) && charMap.get(rightChar) >= windowStart) {
            // Move window start just past the previous occurrence
            windowStart = charMap.get(rightChar) + 1;
        }
        
        // Update character position
        charMap.put(rightChar, windowEnd);
        
        // Update maximum length found so far
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, windowEnd - windowStart + 1);
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}
```

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n) - we process each character exactly once
- Space: O(min(m,n)) - where m is the size of the character set

The sliding window pattern takes practice to master, but once you get comfortable with it, you'll spot its applications everywhere!

## 4. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**When to use it:**
BFS is ideal when you need to find the shortest path or distance in unweighted graphs, trees, or grids. It's also great for level-order traversals where you need to process nodes level by level.

**Why it works:**
By exploring nodes in layers (level by level), BFS guarantees you'll find the shortest path in terms of number of edges.

**Example: [LeetCode 733 ‚Äì Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/)**

Imagine we have a grid representing an image, and we need to "flood fill" from a starting position (like the paint bucket tool).

```java
public int[][] floodFill(int[][] image, int sr, int sc, int color) {
    // If starting pixel already has the target color, no change needed
    int startColor = image[sr][sc];
    if (startColor == color) return image;
    
    int rows = image.length;
    int cols = image[0].length;
    
    // Initialize queue with starting position
    Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.offer(new int[]{sr, sc});
    
    // Possible directions: up, right, down, left
    int[][] directions = {{-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}};
    
    // Process queue (BFS)
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int[] point = queue.poll();
        int r = point[0];
        int c = point[1];
        
        // Fill current pixel
        image[r][c] = color;
        
        // Check all 4 adjacent pixels
        for (int[] dir : directions) {
            int newR = r + dir[0];
            int newC = c + dir[1];
            
            // Ensure new position is valid and has the original color
            if (newR >= 0 && newR < rows && 
                newC >= 0 && newC < cols && 
                image[newR][newC] == startColor) {
                queue.offer(new int[]{newR, newC});
            }
        }
    }
    
    return image;
}
```

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n) - where n is the number of pixels in the image
- Space: O(n) - in worst case, almost all pixels might be in the queue

> **Note:** When implementing BFS, always use a queue (FIFO) data structure. This ensures we process nodes level by level, which is the key to finding shortest paths.

## 5. Depth-First Search (DFS)

**When to use it:**
DFS excels at exploring full paths, finding connected components, or solving problems that involve backtracking. It's particularly useful for:
- Detecting cycles
- Topological sorting
- Exploring all possible paths/combinations
- Connected component analysis

**Why it works:**
By diving deep before backtracking, DFS efficiently explores branches of possibilities.

**Example: [LeetCode 200 ‚Äì Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)**

We have a grid representing land ('1') and water ('0'), and need to count the number of islands.

```java
public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
    if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) return 0;
    
    int rows = grid.length;
    int cols = grid[0].length;
    int islandCount = 0;
    
    // Helper function for DFS
    class DFS {
        void explore(int r, int c) {
            // Check boundaries and if it's land
            if (r < 0 || r >= rows || c < 0 || c >= cols || grid[r][c] == '0') {
                return;
            }
            
            // Mark as visited by changing to water
            grid[r][c] = '0';
            
            // Explore in all 4 directions
            explore(r - 1, c); // Up
            explore(r + 1, c); // Down
            explore(r, c - 1); // Left
            explore(r, c + 1); // Right
        }
    }
    
    DFS dfs = new DFS();
    
    // Scan the grid
    for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            if (grid[r][c] == '1') {
                islandCount++;
                dfs.explore(r, c); // Mark the entire island as visited
            }
        }
    }
    
    return islandCount;
}
```

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(m√ón) - we may need to visit all cells
- Space: O(m√ón) - in worst case for the recursion stack (a single snake-like island)

> **Note:** DFS is often implemented recursively, which makes the code more readable, but be aware of potential stack overflow for very large inputs. In those cases, you can use an explicit stack data structure.

## 6. Two Pointers

**When to use it:**
The two pointers technique is perfect when working with sorted arrays or when you need to find a pair of elements that satisfy certain conditions. It's also great for in-place operations.

**Why it works:**
By using two pointers that move strategically (often from opposite ends), you can solve many problems in a single pass with constant extra space.

**Example: [LeetCode 167 ‚Äì Two Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)**

Given a sorted array, find two numbers that add up to a specific target.

```java
public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        
        if (sum == target) {
            // Found the pair! Return 1-indexed positions
            return new int[] {left + 1, right + 1};
        } else if (sum < target) {
            // Sum too small, move left pointer to increase the sum
            left++;
        } else {
            // Sum too large, move right pointer to decrease the sum
            right--;
        }
    }
    
    // No solution found
    return new int[] {-1, -1};
}
```

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n) - we scan the array at most once
- Space: O(1) - just two pointers regardless of input size

The beauty of the two pointers approach is its simplicity and efficiency. I've used it countless times to optimize solutions from O(n¬≤) to O(n).

## 7. Binary Search

**When to use it:**
Binary search is your go-to whenever you're dealing with a sorted array or when the search space can be divided into halves based on some condition. It's also useful for optimization problems where you need to find a value that satisfies certain criteria.

**Why it works:**
By eliminating half of the remaining elements at each step, binary search achieves O(log n) time complexity - dramatically faster than linear search for large datasets.

**Example: [LeetCode 704 ‚Äì Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)**

```java
public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = nums.length - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        // Calculate middle index (avoiding integer overflow)
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        
        if (nums[mid] == target) {
            return mid; // Found the target
        } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1; // Target is in the right half
        } else {
            right = mid - 1; // Target is in the left half
        }
    }
    
    return -1; // Target not found
}
```

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(log n) - we divide the search space in half each time
- Space: O(1) - constant extra space

> **Note:** Binary search is deceptively tricky to implement correctly. Pay careful attention to the exit condition (`left <= right`) and how you update the boundaries. The classic mistake is infinite loops from improper boundary updates.

## 8. Backtracking

**When to use it:**
Backtracking is powerful for problems where you need to find all possible solutions or explore a space of possibilities with constraints. It's commonly used for:
- Generating combinations/permutations
- Solving puzzles (Sudoku, N-Queens)
- Path finding with constraints

**Why it works:**
Backtracking explores all paths methodically and abandons paths that violate constraints, saving time by not pursuing dead ends.

**Example: [LeetCode 46 ‚Äì Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)**

Generate all possible permutations of a distinct integer array.

```java
public List<List<Integer>> permute(int[] nums) {
    List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
    backtrack(result, new ArrayList<>(), nums, new boolean[nums.length]);
    return result;
}

private void backtrack(List<List<Integer>> result, List<Integer> current, 
                      int[] nums, boolean[] used) {
    // If current permutation is complete
    if (current.size() == nums.length) {
        result.add(new ArrayList<>(current));
        return;
    }
    
    // Try each number as the next in sequence
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Skip if already used in this permutation
        if (used[i]) continue;
        
        // Choose one number
        current.add(nums[i]);
        used[i] = true;
        
        // Explore with this choice
        backtrack(result, current, nums, used);
        
        // Undo the choice (backtrack)
        current.remove(current.size() - 1);
        used[i] = false;
    }
}
```

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n!) - we generate all permutations
- Space: O(n) - for the recursion stack and to store current permutation

Backtracking follows a "try, explore, and undo" pattern that's incredibly powerful for combinatorial problems. The key is defining clear constraints that let you abandon unpromising paths early.

## 9. Stack

**When to use it:**
Stacks are perfect for problems involving:
- Matching pairs (like brackets)
- Tracking history or state that needs to be reversed
- Parsing expressions
- DFS implementations without recursion

**Why it works:**
The Last In, First Out (LIFO) nature of stacks makes them ideal for problems where the most recently seen item is the most important.

**Example: [LeetCode 20 ‚Äì Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)**

Check if a string of brackets is valid (every opening bracket has a matching closing bracket in the correct order).

```java
public boolean isValid(String s) {
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
    Map<Character, Character> pairs = new HashMap<>();
    pairs.put(')', '(');
    pairs.put('}', '{');
    pairs.put(']', '[');
    
    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        if (c == '(' || c == '{' || c == '[') {
            // Push opening brackets onto stack
            stack.push(c);
        } else {
            // For closing brackets, check if it matches the most recent opening bracket
            if (stack.isEmpty() || stack.pop() != pairs.get(c)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Valid only if all brackets were matched (stack is empty)
    return stack.isEmpty();
}
```

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n) - we process each character once
- Space: O(n) - in worst case, we push all opening brackets onto the stack

Stacks are one of those data structures that seem simple but solve an incredible range of problems elegantly. They're especially useful when you need to "remember" things in reverse order.

## 10. Fast & Slow Pointers

**When to use it:**
This pattern is brilliant for linked list problems, especially:
- Detecting cycles
- Finding the middle element
- Finding list length
- Determining if paths intersect

**Why it works:**
By having two pointers moving at different speeds, you can gain insights about the structure without using extra space.

**Example: [LeetCode 141 ‚Äì Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)**

Determine if a linked list has a cycle.

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
    // Edge cases
    if (head == null || head.next == null) return false;
    
    // Initialize two pointers
    ListNode slow = head;
    ListNode fast = head;
    
    // Move slow by 1 step and fast by 2 steps
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
        
        // If they meet, there's a cycle
        if (slow == fast) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    // If fast pointer reaches the end, there's no cycle
    return false;
}
```

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n) - in worst case, we traverse the entire list
- Space: O(1) - just two pointers regardless of list size

This technique is also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm, famously used in Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm. It's amazingly simple yet powerful.

## 11. Dynamic Programming (DP)

**When to use it:**
Dynamic programming is ideal when a problem has:
- Overlapping subproblems (same calculations repeated)
- Optimal substructure (optimal solution can be built from optimal solutions to subproblems)

Common signs include questions about finding minimum/maximum values or counting possible ways to do something.

**Why it works:**
By storing results of subproblems, we avoid redundant calculations and build up to the final solution.

**Example: [LeetCode 70 ‚Äì Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)**

How many different ways can you climb n stairs if you can take 1 or 2 steps at a time?

```java
public int climbStairs(int n) {
    // Edge cases
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    
    // Initialize our dp array
    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    dp[1] = 1; // One way to climb 1 stair
    dp[2] = 2; // Two ways to climb 2 stairs (1+1 or 2)
    
    // Build up from smaller subproblems
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        // To reach stair i, we can either:
        // 1. Take a single step from stair i-1
        // 2. Take a double step from stair i-2
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    
    return dp[n];
}
```

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n) - we calculate each step once
- Space: O(n) - for the dp array

> **Note:** This problem actually follows the Fibonacci sequence pattern! We could optimize to O(1) space by just keeping track of the last two values instead of the entire array.

Dynamic Programming can be challenging to grasp at first, but it follows a pattern:
1. Define what state(s) you need to track
2. Establish a recurrence relation (how values relate)
3. Identify base cases
4. Decide if you need tabulation (bottom-up) or memoization (top-down)

## 12. Trie (Prefix Tree)

**When to use it:**
Tries are specialized for string-based problems, particularly:
- Autocomplete/typeahead features
- Spell checking
- Prefix matching
- Word dictionaries
- IP routing tables

**Why it works:**
Tries store characters in nodes, with words sharing prefixes sharing the same initial nodes, making prefix operations very efficient.

**Example: [LeetCode 208 ‚Äì Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/)**

```java
class Trie {
    class TrieNode {
        Map<Character, TrieNode> children = new HashMap<>();
        boolean isEndOfWord = false;
    }
    
    private TrieNode root;

    public Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    // Insert a word into the trie
    public void insert(String word) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            // Create node if it doesn't exist
            if (!node.children.containsKey(c)) {
                node.children.put(c, new TrieNode());
            }
            
            // Move to the child node
            node = node.children.get(c);
        }
        
        // Mark end of word
        node.isEndOfWord = true;
    }
    
    // Return if word exists in the trie
    public boolean search(String word) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            // If character doesn't exist, word not found
            if (!node.children.containsKey(c)) {
                return false;
            }
            
            // Move to next node
            node = node.children.get(c);
        }
        
        // Word exists only if we reached end of word marker
        return node.isEndOfWord;
    }
    
    // Check if any word with this prefix exists
    public boolean startsWith(String prefix) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        
        for (char c : prefix.toCharArray()) {
            if (!node.children.containsKey(c)) {
                return false;
            }
            node = node.children.get(c);
        }
        
        // If we reach here, prefix exists
        return true;
    }
}
```

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(m) for all operations, where m is the length of the key
- Space: O(n*m) where n is number of keys and m is average key length

Tries might seem complex initially, but they're incredibly efficient for string operations. They're widely used in real-world applications like autocomplete systems, spell checkers, and IP routers.

## Final Thoughts

Mastering these patterns will dramatically improve your problem-solving abilities in technical interviews. Remember, the key isn't just to memorize solutions, but to understand the underlying patterns so you can apply them to new problems.

When tackling a new problem:
1. Take a moment to recognize the pattern
2. Think about why that pattern would work
3. Apply the pattern with the specific details of the problem
4. Always analyze the time and space complexity

I've created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ibsanju/coding-patterns) with complete implementations of all these patterns applied to multiple problems. Feel free to check it out for more practice!
