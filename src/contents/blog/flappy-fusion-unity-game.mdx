# Building Flappy Fusion: Our Unity Game Dev Journey

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm excited to share how our team (Thanush, Dinesh, and myself, Bharath) built **"Flappy Fusion"** â€“ our modern spin on the classic Flappy Bird game. Let's dive into the nuts and bolts of this project, from organization to code!

## What's Flappy Fusion?

Flappy Fusion is exactly what it sounds like â€“ our take on the addictive tap-to-fly mechanic that had everyone hooked a few years back. We've created a colorful world filled with obstacles and unique characters, each team member bringing their own expertise to make this game come alive.

## Project Organization: The Unity Way

When working in a team, good organization is absolutely crucial. Here's how we structured our Unity project to keep everything tidy and maintainable:

### Smart Folder Structure

Let's start with our folder structure â€“ something that saved us countless headaches during development!

#### 1. Fonts Folder

This is where all typography assets live. Keeping fonts separate makes them easy to find and apply consistently.

  alt='Fonts Folder Structure'
  width={640}
  height={360}
/>

#### 2. Materials Folder

For any looping backgrounds, we use materials with textures applied to them:

```
// Example usage: We add texture to material objects for elements like
// backgrounds and ground that need to scroll infinitely
```

#### 3. Prefabs Folder

This is where reusable game objects like our pipe obstacles live:

/>

_Prefab folder where we store our integrated pipe obstacles_

#### 4. Scenes Folder

Flappy Bird has only one level, but we've structured our project to accommodate multiple levels if needed:

  height={360}
/>

_Scene folder showing our main game level_

#### 5. Scripts Folder

The brain of our operation! All project scripts are kept here:

#### 6. Sprites Folder

All visual assets including images and videos are neatly organized here:

  height={200}
/>

Note: Having this clear folder structure was absolutely essential for our team collaboration. It prevented asset conflicts and made it easy for everyone to find what they needed!

## The Code Behind Flappy Fusion

Now for the fun part â€“ let's look at the key scripts that power our game! I'll break down each one with explanations.

### Game Manager Script

This script controls the overall game state â€“ handling score, UI, and game flow:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class gameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public player player;             // Reference to our player script
    public Text scoreText;            // UI element for displaying score
    public GameObject playButton;     // UI button to start the game
    public GameObject gameOver;       // Game over UI panel

    private int score;                // Player's current score

    private void Awake() {
        Application.targetFrameRate = 60;  // Lock to 60fps for consistent gameplay
        Pause();                           // Start in paused state
    }

    public void Play() {
        // Reset game state
        score = 0;
        scoreText.text = score.ToString();
        playButton.SetActive(false);
        gameOver.SetActive(false);

        // Start gameplay
        Time.timeScale = 1f;          // Normal time flow
        player.enabled = true;        // Enable player controls

        // Clean up any existing pipes
        pipes[] pipes = FindObjectsOfType<pipes>();
        for (int i = 0; i < pipes.Length; i++) {
            Destroy(pipes[i].gameObject);
        }
    }

    public void Pause() {
        Time.timeScale = 0f;          // Freeze time
        player.enabled = false;       // Disable player controls
    }

    public void GameOver() {
        gameOver.SetActive(true);     // Show game over UI
        playButton.SetActive(true);   // Show play again button
        Pause();                      // Pause the game
    }

    public void IncreaseScore() {
        score++;                      // Increment score
        scoreText.text = score.ToString();  // Update UI
    }
}
```

### Parallax Background Script

This creates that smooth scrolling background effect:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class NewBehaviourScript : MonoBehaviour  // Note: Should be renamed to "Parallax"!
{
    private MeshRenderer meshRenderer;
    public float animateSpeed = 1f;   // How fast the background scrolls

    private void Awake() {
        meshRenderer = GetComponent<MeshRenderer>();
    }

    private void Update() {
        // Shift texture offset based on time to create scrolling effect
        meshRenderer.material.mainTextureOffset += new Vector2(animateSpeed * Time.deltaTime, 0);
    }
}
```

### Pipes Script

This handles the behavior of our obstacles:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class pipes : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float speed = 5f;          // How fast pipes move
    private float leftEdge;           // Screen boundary for cleanup

    private void Start() {
        // Calculate the left edge of the screen for pipe removal
        leftEdge = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(Vector3.zero).x - 8f;
    }

    private void Update() {
        // Move pipes leftward continuously
        transform.position += Vector3.left * speed * Time.deltaTime;

        // Destroy pipes once they're off-screen
        if(transform.position.x < leftEdge) {
            Destroy(gameObject);
        }
    }
}
```

### Player Script

This is where the magic happens â€“ controls, animation, and collision detection:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class player : MonoBehaviour
{
    private SpriteRenderer spriteRenderer;
    public Sprite[] sprites;          // Array for wing flap animation frames
    private int spriteIndex;          // Current animation frame
    private Vector3 direction;        // Movement direction vector
    public float gravity = -9.8f;     // Gravity strength
    public float strength = 5f;       // Jump/flap strength

    private void Awake() {
        spriteRenderer = GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>();
    }

    private void Start() {
        // Start sprite animation, repeating every 0.15 seconds
        InvokeRepeating(nameof(AnimateSprite), 0.15f, 0.15f);
    }

    private void OnEnable() {
        // Reset position and direction when enabled
        Vector3 position = transform.position;
        position.y = 0f;
        transform.position = position;
        direction = Vector3.zero;
    }

    private void Update() {
        // Handle input - keyboard, mouse, or touch
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space) || Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) {
            direction = Vector3.up * strength;  // Flap upward
        }

        if (Input.touchCount > 0) {
            Touch touch = Input.GetTouch(0);
            if (touch.phase == TouchPhase.Began) {
                direction = Vector3.up * strength;  // Flap on touch
            }
        }

        // Apply gravity and move the player
        direction.y += gravity * Time.deltaTime;
        transform.position += direction * Time.deltaTime;
    }

    private void AnimateSprite() {
        // Cycle through wing flap animation frames
        spriteIndex++;
        if (spriteIndex >= sprites.Length) {
            spriteIndex = 0;
        }
        spriteRenderer.sprite = sprites[spriteIndex];
    }

    private void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D other) {
        // Handle collisions
        if (other.gameObject.tag == "Obstacle") {
            FindObjectOfType<gameManager>().GameOver();  // Game over on pipe hit
        } else if (other.gameObject.tag == "Score") {
            FindObjectOfType<gameManager>().IncreaseScore();  // Increment score on passing
        }
    }
}
```

### Spawner Script

This creates our endless stream of pipe obstacles:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class spawner : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject prefab;         // Pipe prefab to spawn
    public float spawnRate = 1f;      // How often to spawn pipes
    public float minHeight = -1f;     // Minimum vertical position
    public float maxHeight = 1f;      // Maximum vertical position

    private void OnEnable() {
        // Start spawning pipes at regular intervals
        InvokeRepeating(nameof(Spawn), spawnRate, spawnRate);
    }

    private void OnDisable() {
        // Stop spawning when disabled
        CancelInvoke(nameof(Spawn));
    }

    private void Spawn() {
        // Create a new pipe at random height
        GameObject pipes = Instantiate(prefab, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);
        pipes.transform.position += Vector3.up * Random.Range(minHeight, maxHeight);
    }
}
```

## Key Learnings from This Project

Building Flappy Fusion taught us some valuable lessons:

1. **Clean organization matters** - Our folder structure prevented numerous headaches
2. **Component separation works** - Each script handles one specific responsibility
3. **Input handling needs multiple options** - Supporting keyboard, mouse and touch makes games accessible
4. **Physics don't need to be complex** - Simple gravity calculations can create engaging gameplay
5. **Code comments save time** - When team members need to understand each other's work

## What's Next?

The source code for Flappy Fusion is available upon request. We're also planning future enhancements like:
