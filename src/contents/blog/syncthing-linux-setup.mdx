- 🔐 Advanced encryption ensuring end-to-end data security.
- 🖥️ Compatibility across major platforms, including Linux, macOS, Windows, and Android.
- 🌐 Web-based interface facilitating intuitive configuration and management.

---

### **📋 Preliminary Requirements**

Prior to proceeding with the installation, ensure the following:

1. 🖥️ A Linux server environment (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, or CentOS).
2. ⚙️ Proficiency in Linux command-line operations.
3. 🔑 Sudo or administrative privileges on the server.

---

### **Step 1: 🛠️ System Preparation**

Update the server to align with the latest package releases:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

### **Step 2: 🛠️ Syncthing Installation**

#### **Using the Official Repository**

1. Incorporate Syncthing’s official repository: (Optional)

   ```bash
   curl -s https://syncthing.net/release-key.txt | sudo apt-key add -
   echo "deb https://apt.syncthing.net/ syncthing stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/syncthing.list
   ```

2. Update repositories and install Syncthing:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install syncthing -y
   ```

#### **Using Snap**

Alternatively, if Snap is pre-installed, execute the following:

```bash
sudo snap install syncthing
```

---

### **Step 3: 🚀 Initialization**

Launch Syncthing to generate default configuration files:

```bash
syncthing
```

Configuration files will be established within the `~/.config/syncthing` directory.

---

### **Step 4: ⚙️ Configuring as a Systemd Service**

Automate Syncthing initialization during system startup:

1. Create a systemd service file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/syncthing@.service
   ```

2. Insert the following configuration:

   ```plaintext
   [Unit]
   Description=Syncthing - Open Source Continuous File Synchronization
   Documentation=https://docs.syncthing.net/
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=%i
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/syncthing -no-browser -gui-address=0.0.0.0:8384
   Restart=on-failure
   SuccessExitStatus=3 4

   [Install]
   WantedBy=default.target
   ```

3. Enable and initiate the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable syncthing@$USER
   sudo systemctl start syncthing@$USER
   ```

---

### **Step 5: 🔒 Enforcing Web Interface Security**

Default configurations utilize HTTP for the web interface. Enhance security by enabling HTTPS:

1. Edit the configuration file:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.config/syncthing/config.xml
   ```

2. Modify the `<gui>` section:

   ```xml
   <gui enabled="true" tls="true">
     <address>0.0.0.0:8384</address>
   </gui>
   ```

3. Restart Syncthing to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart syncthing@$USER
   ```

---

### **Step 6: 🛡️ Configuring Firewall Access**

Enable Syncthing’s communication ports in your server’s firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22000/tcp
sudo ufw allow 21027/udp
sudo ufw allow 8384/tcp
```

---

### **Step 7: 🌐 Web Interface Access**

Access the Syncthing web interface at the following URL:

```
https://<your-server-ip>:8384
```

Through this portal, you can link devices, define shared directories, and initiate synchronization workflows.

#### **📜 Script Usage**

1. Download the script:

   ```bash
   curl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/IbsanjU/41f57a1831f987b1a1d249d3150bf6fa/raw/88c67c2a4505731fb9c887286022b644bd200569/install_syncthing.sh
   ```

2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x install_syncthing.sh
   ```

3. Execute the script:

   ```bash
   ./install_syncthing.sh
   ```
